            <h1>Food Delevery App </h1>
            <p>This project is a fully responsive, modern UI for a Food Delivery App, designed to enhance user
                experience and meet the standards of contemporary applications. The interface offers a visually
                appealing, intuitive design tailored for food delivery. It includes key features commonly found in food
                delivery platforms, like food category browsing, cart management, and a seamless ordering process.</p>
            <h2>What I’ve Done</h2>
            <p>
                In the Food Delivery App project, I have developed a fully responsive layout that utilizes CSS flexbox
                and grid, ensuring optimal viewing across devices. This responsiveness guarantees that whether accessed
                from a mobile, tablet, or desktop, the app maintains a consistent user experience without compromising
                functionality. I designed various modern UI components, such as navigation menus, food category
                sections, search bars, and a dynamic cart preview, all while adhering to contemporary UI/UX design
                trends. The application features a visually appealing color palette and typography, enhancing both
                usability and attractiveness. I also incorporated interactive animations and transitions, which provide
                a more engaging experience for users. For example, hover effects and smooth transitions make
                interactions with buttons and menu items feel seamless.</p>

            <h1>NewsMonkey Web Application</h1>
            <p>The NewsMonkey Web Application is a dynamic platform designed to aggregate and categorize news articles
                across various topics, providing users with a seamless way to stay informed about the latest
                developments. This application fetches real-time news from reliable sources, allowing users to explore
                current events tailored to their interests. The user-friendly interface categorizes news into distinct
                sections, such as politics, technology, sports, entertainment, and more, ensuring that users can easily
                navigate to their preferred content.

                One of the standout features of NewsMonkey is its responsive design, which guarantees optimal viewing

                at home or on the go, the application adjusts its layout and functionality to provide a consistent and
                engaging user experience.</p>
            <h2>What I’ve Done</h2>
            <p>In the development of the NewsMonkey Web Application, I focused on creating a comprehensive and
                user-friendly platform for accessing real-time news across various categories. I implemented a robust
                backend system that integrates with multiple news APIs to fetch the latest articles, ensuring that users
                always have access to current information. The application categorizes news into distinct sections such
                as politics, technology, sports, entertainment, and health, making it easy for users to navigate and
                find content relevant to their interests. To enhance user experience across all devices, I adopted a
                responsive design approach using modern front-end frameworks, ensuring that the application retains its
                functionality and aesthetics on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.</p>
