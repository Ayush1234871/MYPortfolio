            <h1>SMS Spam Classification</h1>
            <p>The SMS Spam Classification project is a machine learning-based application designed to distinguish
                between spam and legitimate (ham) text messages. This classification system is crucial for enhancing
                user experience by filtering out unwanted, potentially harmful messages and allowing only valuable,
                relevant communications to reach users. The model is trained on a labeled dataset of SMS messages, where
                each message is categorized as either "spam" or "ham." By utilizing natural language processing (NLP)
                techniques and machine learning algorithms, this project builds an accurate classifier that
                automatically identifies spam messages based on word patterns, frequency, and context. The end goal is
                to create a robust, scalable model that can efficiently process large volumes of messages in real-time,
                enhancing the reliability of spam filtering in messaging applications.</p>
            <h2>What I’ve Done</h2>
            <p>
                In this project, I developed an ensemble learning model for SMS Spam Classification that achieved a high
                accuracy of 98.12%. The model combines multiple algorithms, including Support Vector Machine (SVM),
                Multinomial Naive Bayes (MNB), and Extra Trees Classifier (ETC), to enhance predictive performance by
                capturing a broader range of spam patterns and features. This ensemble approach proved to be highly
                effective, outperforming individual classifiers.

                Additionally, I authored and published a research paper on this project with IEEE, detailing the
                methodology, experimental results, and the model’s comparative advantage. The publication highlights the
                significance of this work for improving SMS spam detection systems, as well as the potential for further
                applications in spam filtering and content moderation.</p>

            <h1>Sentiment Analysis On Amazon Alexa Product</h1>
            <p>This project is focused on analyzing user reviews for the Amazon Alexa product, utilizing machine
                learning techniques to understand customer sentiment. By examining reviews, the project aims to identify
                patterns and classify each review’s sentiment as either positive or negative. This information can be
                valuable for Amazon or developers to understand user satisfaction and to pinpoint areas for improvement.
            </p>
            <h2>What I’ve Done</h2>
            <p>
            <h4>Data Preprocessing and Cleaning:</h4>
            Collected and cleaned Amazon Alexa review data, removing noise like punctuation, special characters, and
            stop words to improve data quality.
            Standardized text by tokenizing and converting it into a machine-readable format using techniques like
            TF-IDF or word embeddings.

            <h4>Model Development:</h4>
            Experimented with several machine learning algorithms, such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, and
            Support Vector Machine, to identify the most accurate model for sentiment classification.
            Implemented and fine-tuned the best-performing model to maximize accuracy and minimize false
            classifications.

            <h4>Sentiment Classification:</h4>
            Trained the model to categorize reviews as either positive or negative, achieving high classification
            accuracy.
            Used techniques like cross-validation to ensure the model’s robustness and reliability in handling
            real-world review data.

            <h4>Insights and Visualization:</h4>
            Analyzed sentiment trends within customer reviews to gain insights into the general perception of Amazon
            Alexa.
            Visualized the distribution of sentiments using charts and graphs to highlight customer satisfaction and
            potential areas for improvement.

            <h4>Performance Evaluation:</h4>
            Measured the model’s performance using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and
            F1-score to confirm its reliability in real-world applications.
            Improved the model iteratively by testing different configurations, leading to an optimized model
            capable of effectively classifying sentiment.
