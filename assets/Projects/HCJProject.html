            <h1>Algo Hub Web Application</h1>
            <p>The Algo Hub Web Application is an educational platform designed to make learning Data Structures and
                Algorithms (DSA) accessible and engaging. This web application offers a user-friendly interface,
                ensuring that learners can focus on understanding algorithms without getting overwhelmed by complex
                navigation.</p>
            <h2>What I’ve Done</h2>
            <p>
            <h4>Comprehensive Algorithm Library:</h4>
            The app provides a wide range of algorithms, each with in-depth descriptions. For example, if a user
            wants to learn about Linear Search, they can select it from the menu. They will then see a clear
            explanation of the algorithm, including its use cases, time complexity, and efficiency.

            <h4>Multi-Language Code Support:</h4>
            To support diverse programming needs, Algo Hub presents code for each algorithm in 5 popular programming
            languages, making it adaptable for users learning different languages. These may include C++, Java,
            Python, JavaScript, and C#. This multi-language approach encourages a broad range of learners to
            understand and implement algorithms regardless of their preferred programming language.

            <h4>Visual Flowcharts:</h4>
            Visual aids are integral to understanding complex algorithms. Each algorithm is accompanied by a
            flowchart, helping users follow the logic flow and improve their conceptual understanding. This visual
            element clarifies each step, making it easier to see the process from start to finish.

            <h4>Clean User Interface:</h4>
            The interface of Algo Hub is intentionally minimalistic, enabling users to concentrate on content
            without distractions. It is structured to allow learners to quickly navigate through algorithms, view
            code examples, and study flowcharts all within the same page.

            <h4>Search and Filter Options:</h4>
            A search bar and filter options make it easy for users to quickly find specific algorithms or data
            structures. This feature is particularly helpful as the algorithm library expands, enabling users to
            locate their topics of interest efficiently.</p>
